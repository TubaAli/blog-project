This project also uses the basic CRUD principles for creating, reading, updating and deleting blog posts and comments. 

Postgresql is used as database and bulma for UI part.

Usage: This app can be used to put up questions and answers them in your organization. I have temporarily deployed it on Heroku at https://blog-project-1.herokuapp.com/.
